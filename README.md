# In this project,
we will create a network intrusion detector, a prediction model
that can distinguish between "good" or normal connections and "bad"
connections, sometimes known as intrusions or attacks. A wide range of
intrusions that were modeled in a network environment of the military are
included in this dataset. MIT Lincoln Labs developed and supervised the
management of the data required to construct the Intrusion detector.
